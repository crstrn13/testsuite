"""
Test for plain identity.

Plain identity expects authentication/identity verification to be done in advance and a trusted identity object
being accessible from AuthJson in given path.
If path does not exist or there is a null value there the request is not authorized (401).
If path exists the value is copied over to `auth.identity` of AuthJson and 200 OK is returned

See also https://github.com/Kuadrant/authorino/blob/main/docs/features.md#plain-authenticationplain

There is no authentication/identity verification done, the test just picks HTTP method as if it was an identity object.
